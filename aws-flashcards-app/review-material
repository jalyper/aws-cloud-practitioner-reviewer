# AWS Cloud Practitioner Notes

## Core Concepts

### Availability Zone
- A single data center or group of data centers within a Region.
- A region consists of 3 or more availability zones.
- A fully isolated portion of the AWS global infrastructure.

### Edge Location
- A site that Amazon CloudFront uses to store cached copies of your content closer to your customers for faster delivery.

### AWS Shared Responsibility Model
- Divides responsibilities into:
    - **Customer:** "security *in* the cloud". Security of everything that they create and put in the AWS Cloud.
    - **AWS:** "security *of* the cloud". The physical infrastructure that hosts your resources.
- AWS responsibilities include:
    - Physical security of data centers
    - Hardware and software infrastructure
    - Network infrastructure
    - Virtualization infrastructure

## Compute

### Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

#### Instance Types
- **General Purpose:** A balance of memory, compute, and networking.
- **Compute Optimized:** Ideal for processing batches.
- **Memory Optimized:** For large datasets in memory, such as high-performance databases.

#### Pricing Models
- **On-Demand:** Pay for compute time by the hour or second.
- **Reserved Instances (RI):**
    - Provide a significant discount (up to 72%) compared to On-Demand.
    - Require a commitment of 1 or 3 years (3-year offers a larger discount).
    - Provide a capacity reservation when used in a specific Availability Zone.
- **Spot Instances:**
    - Does not require a minimum contract length.
    - Able to withstand interruptions.
    - Costs less than an On-Demand Instance.
    - Up to 90% cost savings for workloads that can handle interruptions (e.g., batch processing).

#### Storage
- **EBS Volumes (Elastic Block Store):**
    - Virtual hard drives you can attach to your EC2 instance to persist data.
    - Allows taking snapshots for data restoration.
    - Separate from the host computer of an EC2 instance.
- **Instance Store:**
    - Ideal for temporary data.
    - Data is deleted when an EC2 instance is stopped or terminated.

### Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
- Automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple resources (e.g., EC2 instances).
- Helps prevent any single resource from being overutilized.

### Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
- A fully managed Kubernetes service.
- Kubernetes is open-source software for deploying and managing containerized applications at scale.

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Provide code and configuration settings, and Elastic Beanstalk deploys the necessary resources.
- Handles:
    - Capacity adjustment
    - Load balancing
    - Automatic scaling
    - Application health monitoring

### AWS Lambda
- Run code without provisioning or managing servers (serverless).
- Charged based on the number of requests and execution time.
- **Free Tier:** 1 million free requests and up to 3.2 million seconds of compute time per month.
- **Compute Savings Plan:** Offers lower costs for a 1-year or 3-year commitment.

## Networking & Content Delivery

### Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- **Internet Gateway:** A component used to connect a VPC to the internet.
- **Security Groups:**
    - Act as a firewall for EC2 instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic.
    - Stateful: if you send a request from your instance, the response traffic is automatically allowed.
    - Deny all inbound traffic by default.
- **Network ACLs (Access Control Lists):**
    - Act as a firewall for subnets, controlling inbound and outbound traffic.
    - Perform **stateless packet filtering**: they check packets crossing the subnet border each way (inbound and outbound) without remembering previous packets.

### AWS Direct Connect
- Establishes a dedicated private connection between an on-premises data center and a VPC.

### Amazon CloudFront
- A global content delivery network (CDN) service.
- Uses a network of **Edge Locations** to cache content closer to customers for faster delivery (videos, photos, webpages, etc.).
- **Origin:** The server from which CloudFront gets your files (e.g., S3 buckets, web servers).

### Amazon Route 53
- A scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service.
- Translates domain names into IP addresses.
- Connects user requests to AWS infrastructure (e.g., EC2 instances, load balancers) and infrastructure outside of AWS.
- Manages DNS records for domain names (you can register new domains or transfer existing ones).
- **With CloudFront:** Allows clients to access web content via the nearest edge location.

### AWS Outposts
- Extends AWS infrastructure and services to other locations, including on-premises data centers.
